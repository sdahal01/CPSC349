          <p>To keep myself active during the lockdown I took my bike to a trail</p>
          <p>and discovered many new places that I wasn't aware of before.</p>
          <p>Since most of the gyms were closed I went to the trail with my bike to</p>
          <p>to get the daily workout done and It was very fun and refreshing.</p>
