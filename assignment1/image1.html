        <p>The reason I choose this picture is because during this panamic</p>
        <p>we all had to stay at home and since there were limited activity</p>
        <p> for us to do, Netflix has been our source of entertainment. I have</p>
        <p>been wathing Netflix whenever I have free time to keep myself entertained.</p>
